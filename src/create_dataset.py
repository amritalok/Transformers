"""Helper functions for working with Hugging Face datasets for translation tasks."""

# Since we're exclusively using Hugging Face datasets, we don't need most of the previous code.
# This file is kept for reference but its functionality has been moved to train.py.

# The recommended approach for translation tasks with Hugging Face:
# 1. Load a dataset directly using datasets.load_dataset()
# 2. Use a pre-trained tokenizer from Hugging Face
# 3. Process the dataset using the dataset.map() method

# Example usage in train.py:
# from datasets import load_dataset
# from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# 
# # Load dataset
# dataset = load_dataset("wmt14", "fr-en")
# 
# # Load tokenizer
# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
# 
# # Process dataset
# def preprocess_function(examples):
#     inputs = [ex["en"] for ex in examples["translation"]]
#     targets = [ex["fr"] for ex in examples["translation"]]
#     model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=128, truncation=True)
#     with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
#         labels = tokenizer(targets, max_length=128, truncation=True)
#     model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
#     return model_inputs
# 
# tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
#     return src_batch, tgt_batch
